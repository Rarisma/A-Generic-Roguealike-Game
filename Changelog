- Changed Auto-Update
- Modules can now be installed Automatically
- Completly rewrote code
- Added Multiple resources (upto 4 in 1 area)
- Realised that Amubush is usually triggered unless you are lighting fast becuase it was looping
- Made enemys now generate in 3 parts, this drastically increases the ammount of unique enemy names (This can also result in stupid names aswell!)
- Made weather effects sun and clouds work and display correctly and capped the multiplier at 5 rarther than 10


ToDo:
-make prefixes suffixes rarer
-make prefix and suffix buff enemy
-make sunny and cloudy weather only gen on new terrain (Terrain thats been genned that turn)

idk if anyone will see this but hello to anyone reading this from the code vault! this is a prealpha version! I dont know much about how this code thing works but should any data get cut from any version
I'll give a quick run down on how to make it work again
1) get a release or the latest file (Release would probably be better)
2) Get a data pack (Preferably that version 1.0 and forward don't have data packs as their built in)
if the ver is less than 1.0
    3) this needs running on python 3.x (I wrote this on 3.8)
    4) Should a data pack not exist look at the latest dev or 1.x py file
    5) create \data\ (this uses windows format paths)
    6) Search for every linecache call in that binary
    7) go to the py file and look for WorldData variables 
    8) Move the WorldData Variables into the files
    9) These must be without \n and " and also 1 line per entry
    10) Create a Slots.txt in \Data\ and look for a readme.txt that should detail how slots.txt is suposed to look like
        should a readme not exist look for all instances of slots in the py file and see which line in slots.txt they are calling
        after this put the ammount of lines in this slots.txt lines (20 terrain lines? put 20 in the line slots is looking for)
else
3) play
4) play Path Of A New Dawn
5) Look for other stuff made from me?
    - hopefully its not as lackluster
