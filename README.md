# Roguealike-RPG
RougalikeRPG is a text based rougalike RPG, you start in the middle of nowhere, with every turn giving a new challenge.

To play all you need is a version of rougalike.py and the data folder

# Note on 1.0
After atempting to work on 0.9 it became increasingly clear that a complete rewrite of the code is needed which would take too much time to release before Febuary 14th so instead im moving the release date back to March 1st and taking this time to properly document features and clean the ever increasing bodged code I will also be including way more features, terrains, resources and enemys

Furthermore I will be releasing several alpha versions of the 1.0 before the release date in the dev branch the next Alpha build will be released on the 7th of Febuary
