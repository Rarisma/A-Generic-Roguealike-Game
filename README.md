# How to play
- Get the latest version of Python if you don't have it (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Download the python file (Rougalike.py)
- Run the file

#Modding
This game is designed to be easy to mod however the game is in early alpha and while modding is available I will not document how to edit it properly until the game is nearly finished (It seems it will be ready around late November/Earlt December)
